# Bookstore JUnit 5 Testing

This project demonstrates how to test a **Bookstore Management System** using **JUnit 5**, **Mockito**, and **JaCoCo**. It covers how to perform **unit tests** (defining them with JUnit 5), how to create **mocks** (defining them with Mockito), and how to measure **code coverage** using JaCoCo.

## Summary

### JUnit 5 Features Used:
- `@Test`: Marks test methods.
- `@BeforeEach`: Runs before each test.
- `@DisplayName`: Provides a readable test name.
- `assertThrows()`: Tests exceptions.

### Mockito:
- `mock()`: Mocks `BookRepository`.
- `when().thenReturn()`: Defines return values.
- `verify()`: Ensures methods were called.

### JaCoCo:
- Measures code coverage for unit tests.
- Generates reports in HTML format.
- Helps ensure sufficient test coverage.

This setup is a clean, modular, and maintainable way to test book management using **JUnit 5, Mockito, and JaCoCo**. ðŸš€

## Running the Tests
To execute all tests, navigate to the project root and run:

```sh
mvn test
```

## Generating Code Coverage Report with JaCoCo
JaCoCo is used to measure test coverage. To generate a test coverage report, follow these steps:

1. **Run Tests with JaCoCo enabled:**

   ```sh
   mvn clean test
   ```

2. **Generate Coverage Report:**

   ```sh
   mvn jacoco:report
   ```

3. **View Report:**
   Open the generated HTML report located at:

   ```
   target/site/jacoco/index.html
   ```

## Mockito Methods
| Method | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `when(repository.findById("1")).thenReturn(Optional.of(book))` | Mocks behavior: When `findById("1")` is called, return `book`. |
| `verify(repository, times(1)).save(book)` | Ensures `save(book)` was called exactly once. |
| `assertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -> { service.getBookById("999"); })` | Tests for exceptions when a book is not found. |
